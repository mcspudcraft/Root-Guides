Instructions:

Boot into stock recovery (volume up+home+power), and select "apply update from external storage". Now select the cwm-touch-6.0.1.4-i9100.zip file you downloaded in previous step by using the volume up/down rocker to navigate and the power button to select option (this step gives a temporary flash that will disappear after reboot)

Inside the newly flashed CWM recovery, select "install zip from sdcard". Now, scroll down to the Root.zip file and hit power button to select it. Once it's done, reboot.

Now look in your app drawer for "Super SU"

Open it and install the binaries.

Now download "root checker" from the play store to check root status.
